// Exercise: JSON!! - Unknown beforehand data

// Now the JSON will be unstructured (we won't know the values beforehand)
// When data is unstructured, we will create a map of strings to empty interfaces.
// Create a map of string to an empty interface called "result"
// Unmarshall (decode) the json into the result
// Get the "birds" object into a variable called "birds" and print it's values
